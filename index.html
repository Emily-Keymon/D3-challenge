          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h2>

          <p>Mississippi has the highest level of obesity at 35.5% with a poverty rate of 21.5%.  Mississippi also
            has the highest level of people lacking healthcare at 18.8%.  This would indicate a direct correlation
            between obesity, poverty and access to healthcare.</p>

          <p>Conversely, Maryland has the second lowest poverty rate at 10.1% with only 9.2% of people lacking healthcare.
              Only 14.6% of people from Maryland are smokers and have the second lowest obesity rate at 29.6%.  Maryland also
              comes in with the highest income at $73,971.  These are all indicators that income and poverty level
              have a direct correlation to obesity, poverty and access to healthcare.</p>

          <p>At 23%, Mississippi is ranked sixth highest of people who smoke versus poverty percent.  Ironically,
              Mississippians who smoke have less access to healthcare than other states therefore putting them
              at more risk of illness and death.</p>

            <p>Maryland has the second lowest smoking percent at 14.6%.  With fewer smokers and better access to
              healthcare, this indicates that people from Maryland have lower risks of illness and death.</p>
